A melanoma detection CNN

This notebook is based on the following [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7590963)

The dataset used to train this model comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/drscarlat/melanoma). The dataset includes a training set of about ten thousand photos of melanoma and not melanoma cases (50% each). 

The model achieves an accuracy of about 85% on the cross-validation set, outperforming the original paper (81% accuracy).
